# Thoughts on the Mapathon

I attended the Intro to QGIS workshop and the keynote with Ben Welsh. The QGIS workshop was really great, and it made interested to use it more in the future. I think one thing that would have made it go smoother was to put the link so people could download the program and the data beforehand. I felt that the QGIS interface was a lot more user friendly than ArcGIS. I also attended the keynote, which I thought was very interesting to hear someone applying the things we're working on in a real life application. One of my main news sources is LA Times, and I do think the data graphics add a lot to the news-reading experience. I especially like the wildfire map, which I use often, but I liked hearing about the team's other efforts.
