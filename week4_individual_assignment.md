My name is Robyn and I'm a second year MURP with a concentration in Design and Development. 

A project idea I have is related to my capstone project, which has to do with financial incentives for land conservation in California. I would like to do a data science project where I can see what the composition of the lands within existing conservation easements is, like if they protect important agricultural lands or what kind of vegetation they protect. I think this work will show something new because easements are not part of a unified system; they are held privately, are in land trusts/ngos, or held by municipalities/state agencies. I hope the data visualizations will reveal what the existing status of California land conservation is.
